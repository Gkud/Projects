Average Ratings: 5.00 out of 5
Summary:The bail-loop (for hanging the pendant) is wide enough to fit most chains, except not the big chunky rapper-style chains.Inside the usual plain Amazon delivery carton, the necklace arrived with both a box and a bag: a small, navy-blue jewelry-style box, and a small purple velveteen bag with drawstring closure.I got this necklace as i gift - which I picked out!And I love it...I get so many compliments on it everytime I wear it.It's unique and beautiful, and goes with anything.It's a piece that makes a statement.

Summary:They match her Mother of the Bride dress beautifully, with enough pink (not too much), traditional pearls, the elongated style is more slimming to the face, and they have a hint of crystals sparkling on each ear- perfect!I love pink pearls and was looking for a pair of simple, drop earrings that I could wear out and about.

Average Ratings: 5.00 out of 5
Summary:Excellent presentation, beautiful sterling silver ring, and a reasonable price.a lighter shade of purple than i prefer in my amethysts, but a nice enough ring to add to my collection... has maintained it's shine for several weeks and gets a fair number of compliments when i wear it... true to size, arrived sooner than expected; i've purchased from this seller before and likely will again... i like the shape and style of the ring but i was slightly disappointed in how small it is in person compared to how it looks online, also i usually enjoy darker amethysts than this one, but overall the product came on time and i do like it.

Average Ratings: 4.29 out of 5
Summary:I had purchased the necklace being shown here, although do to my own mistake i assumed it would be more of a man's style necklace, and heavier, so i had to return it, but the quality and design itself were of high quality, if i'd have been a female or had someone to give it to i would have kept it, and then continued shopping again.with returning the necklace, the company had NO (0) issues with my asking for a refund and processed it in less than 24 hours, I would be happy to continue using this company for further purchases, seeing how they have the customer's satisfaction in mind, not just one of those companies that's worried about a bottom line, and making you jump through hoops to deal with a refund or credit.this is one of the greatest companies i've dealt with in the past 10 years i've been buying any style of jewelery online.very prompt and efficient in handling questions, concerns they really bend over backwards to maker their customers happy and satisfied.Its light weight as well.Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver 1.5 MM Rope 24" Chain NecklaceIts good quality.
