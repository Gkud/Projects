Product: Bracketron PHW-203-BL Mobile Grip-iT Rotating Windshield Mount for GPS
Average Ratings: 3.62 out of 5
Summary:The Bracketron is better because of the arms on the sides give you more options for different phones (different charging/data port receptacle spots)The Kensington allows you to rotate the phone around for "Landcape/Horizontal" view, but in my humble opinion, the versatility of the arms can't be beat.Be gentle with the teeth that help you tighten the suction cup down on the windshield, they will get brittle and break..and you're out of luck after that...good thing they are cheap.Releasing the phone is very easy too, you just push the button on the bottom and the side arms release the pressure and slide out allowing for easy retrieval of your phone or GPS unit.This unit is made to mount to the windshield or some other smooth surface.


Product: Sony Ericsson S710a Phone (AT&T)
Average Ratings: 3.52 out of 5
Summary:It is a beautifully designed and well built phone.Pros-Screen (big,bright and clear)-Reception is great-1.3MP camera (decent camera phone, won't replace your regular camera but not bad for a phone)-Bluetooth capableCons-Sometimes there is a little lag after hitting buttons, annoying but not a big problem-Talk and standby times are short and you will need to recharge often I was looking for a phone that would do quite nearly everything, and was hoping that the Sony Ericsson S710a was going to be the new baby to do just that.I liked the fact that it was a phone, PDA and quickie camera all-in-one.PROs: Great Camera (Best I've seen yet on a phone); Swivel design is awesome and comfortable; MP3 Player rocks and sounds great; bluetooth makes it so much easier syncing with your computer and other devices, included 32MB memory internal PLUS 32MB memory stick duo makes taking pictures and videos and transferring them fun and easy; the screen is big, crisp, and clear; 3-D gaming is wicked hot -- look fantastic; Tools are great and easy to use; Music DJ ring-tone maker is fun.CONs: Price for regular consumers is outrageous; menus can be slow.Overall this is one outstanding phone.


Product: Cardo Systems Scala 500 Bluetooth Headset, Black
Average Ratings: 3.46 out of 5
Summary:First off I'll go ahead and give the verdict on the Cardo Scala 500 BT headset: It's awesome.Phones used: Palm Treo 650 and 700pAbout 4 years ago I bought a Sony Ericsson cellphone which was too small for comfortable use and I bought my first bluetooth headset (a Jabra 250).The HS-850 would drop the BT connection (though not the phonecall) randomly during conversation, the sound quality was very tinny according to people I spoke with and the volume was very poor on my end.I thought I'd look through Amazon and try to get another Scala 500.


Product: Tekkeon ezTalker ET2000 Mini Bluetooth Headset
Average Ratings: 3.45 out of 5
Summary:You can do voice dialing, receive call (stops music if you have that feature in your cell phone) and much more..I am using it with my Sony Ericsson S710a without any problem and it is universal so works with any bluetooth phone...BUY IT (good deal on eBay) I've had this headset for a couple of months and although I have tried to be happy with it... it does have it's problems.It comes with two ear plug attachments and neither is very comfortable for an extended period of time.Seems to be much more sensitive to wind noise than the Moto 850 (which has such low max volume capability that I bought the Tekkeon in hopes of replacing it).


Product: Plantronics Explorer 350 Bluetooth Headset
Average Ratings: 3.38 out of 5
Summary:Here's my lowdown:Positive:- easy set up and use- good sound- balances well on the ear and easy to put on- nice options charging in car or via a USB port- nice options for mounting it in the car- nice phone ringing tone in the earpieceNegatives:- no built-in mute function (that I can find)- if you want to recharge via outlet, you have to purchase a chargerThis is my second Plantronics bluetooth headset.It's simply a molded piece which holds your charger and earpiece together, but you've got to fiddle to make it work.At least with our model, the charger fits loosely; after too much wiggling (like, say, while driving in a car), the charger will come loose and the headset will need reconnected.Overall, I'd really recommend this piece, especially for the price.
